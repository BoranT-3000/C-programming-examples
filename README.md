# C-programming-examples

The examples that you see here are the ones I wrote, found, and converted while Ä± was learning c programming.


if you are having problem about running your program after long runs you can use 

"//taskkill /F /IM  file_name.exe"  use this code in cmd 

//if you cannot open  file_name.exe for writing
